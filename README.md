# PhyloInfer

The goal of this package is to develop efficient approximate inference methods for Bayesian phylogenetics. So far, 
we have implemented a probablistic path Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian phylogenetic inference.


# Prerequisites

PhyloInfer is a python package that is built on ETE toolkit and biopython

* [ete3](http://etetoolkit.org)
* [Bio](http://biopython.org)
